# TODO — Seamly2D app features

Tasks that add features to the Seamly2D pattern-drafting app.

Tasks in this file begin with `Seamly2D.`

## [ ] Task Seamly2D.1 — Seamly2D: optional single-stroke (Hershey) label display and export

**Scope decision (2026-07-18):** outline fonts remain fully acceptable in Seamly2D — the existing outline-font canvas display and exports stay the default and are NOT removed or locked out. This task adds single-stroke (Hershey-style) label support as an *option*, so a designer targeting a cutter/plotter can preview labels on the canvas the way the machine will draw them and export matching single-stroke output.

Current label text handling (all outline-font based, and staying available): the canvas paints labels with the user-selected `QFont` via `painter->drawText()` (`VTextGraphicsItem::paint()`, `src/libs/vwidgets/vtextgraphicsitem.cpp`); the `textAsPaths == true` branch of `VLayoutPiece::createLabelItem()` (`src/libs/vlayout/vlayoutpiece.cpp`) outlines glyphs via `QPainterPath::addText()`; DXF text goes through `VDxfEngine::drawTextItem()` (`src/libs/vdxf/vdxfengine.cpp`).

**Constraint:** neither Windows nor Qt has native stroke-font support — the OS/Qt typography stack (`QFont`) only loads outline TTF/OTF, and a true single-stroke font cannot be installed as a system font (Windows errors on it or auto-closes the open contours into filled shapes). Two known workarounds exist in the wild:

1. **App-internal stroke-glyph data** (the true single-stroke route) — bypass the system font stack entirely and render strokes from Hershey glyph data inside the app, as Inkscape's *Hershey Text* extension does (Hershey Sans/Serif/Script 1-stroke, Gothic, and Duplex/Triplex multi-stroke variants). **This is the approach for this task** — the custom renderer below; prior art also includes Valentina's single-line/SVG-font label support.
2. **"Hairline" TTFs** — engineered fonts that trace each line forward and back over itself so the closed outline *looks* like a single stroke (e.g. CamBam Stick Fonts — free, 9 variants for CNC/plotting; MecSoft/Rhino single-stroke; commercial single-line TTF bundles). These install as normal Windows fonts and work in ordinary apps, but they are still outlines (doubled-back), stroke width isn't controllable via the font, and licensing must be checked before bundling. Relevant mainly as the embeddable-`<text>` option in Task 21 mode 2, not for this task's renderer.

- [ ] Seamly2D.1.1 Choose and bundle the stroke-glyph source (Hershey glyph data and/or single-line SVG fonts) under a GPL-compatible license; record the decision in the repo docs
- [ ] Seamly2D.1.2 Implement a single-stroke text renderer: shape a label line into stroked (fill-less) `QPainterPath` polylines with proper advance/kerning, honoring size, bold/italic variants (stroke width/slant), alignment, eliding, mirroring, and rotation
- [ ] Seamly2D.1.3 Add the option to the label settings UI: extend the label font selection (preferences Graphics View page / piece label settings) with the bundled single-stroke fonts alongside the existing system outline fonts; outline stays the default
- [ ] Seamly2D.1.4 Canvas: when a single-stroke font is selected, render labels with the stroke renderer in `VTextGraphicsItem` so the preview matches what a plotter will draw; outline-font labels keep the existing `painter->drawText()` path
- [ ] Seamly2D.1.5 Export: when a single-stroke font is selected, the `textAsPaths == true` branch of `createLabelItem()` emits single-stroke paths for those labels (outline-font labels keep the existing `QPainterPath::addText()` conversion); DXF export of single-stroke labels emits polylines
- [ ] Seamly2D.1.6 Coordinate with Task 10/Task 21: labels in a single-stroke font exporting as `<text>` should reference the bundled single-line font name so SeamlyLayout can match it
- [ ] Seamly2D.1.7 Verify: canvas single-stroke labels legible at typical zooms with correct placement, mirroring, and rotation; outline-font behavior unchanged everywhere; tagged pieces SVG / `.pieces.svg` / `--text2paths` / DXF / PDF / PNG correct in both font modes
- [ ] Seamly2D.1.8 Doxygen briefs + inline comments on all touched functions; document the font architecture in the repo docs

## [x] Task Seamly2D.4 — Preferences > Paths has no row for bodyscans
